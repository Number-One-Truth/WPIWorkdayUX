                      MyWorkday is a scheduling and financial tool used by WPI students, professors, and administrators. Through the application, students are able to register for classes, view academic progression, pay tuition, and perform other relevant academic and financial tasks. In this sense, Workday serves as an automated mediary between students and administration. WPI began implementing Workday last year, with the purpose to replace the old scheduling and financial software: Banner Web. Thus far, the introduction of Workday has created some frustration for students who have not adjusted to the new user interface. This paper will analyze the current website for ways that Workday could improve their website design and overall user experience.
                      To start off, we will take a look at the “academics” homepage. Right away, we see the “helpful links” banner taking up a large amount of screen space at the top of the screen. Workday should consider moving or shrinking the banner as the placement takes the users’ attention away from the main registration content. Moving on to the actual registration process, there is no clear area or button to click to begin the registration process. In BannerWeb, there was a “create a schedule button”, which would lead students through a course selection then registration process. Because the registration menu in Workday lacks this main process button, students end up clicking multiple buttons until they figure out where to navigate to. One final critique is that the “Actions to Do” section takes up about a quarter of the screen. It is a rather simple dashboard that displays the number of: tasks that a user must complete, holds on their account, and tasks that a user has completed. Because it does not display any significantly important information, it may be beneficial to reduce the size of the dashboard and utilize the space more effectively. 
                      Continuing to the course search process, the current procedures are rather detailed and may be too overwhelming to the user. The course search popup menu, for example, requires the user to choose from four start date periods, future, current, past, and non-year. For students registering for next semester courses, the plethora of options may not be entirely beneficial, and can even be rather annoying to click through subsections just to get to next semester courses. In total, it takes four clicks just to navigate to the current term. Another use case that Workday should consider is the student that already knows which course they want to take. A search bar option would prove useful in that it saves users from having to fill out search conditions. Once the user navigates to the course search menu, there are 13 filter sections for the student to choose from. Some of these sections are repetitive and rather unnecessary, but add to the complexity of the course search page. One final annoyance that users may complain about is that users must click into a course page to add it to their schedule. An option to select and add multiple courses from the course search page would save users time from having to click into each individual course page. An additional feature that would help enhance the user experience could be the implementation of major and minor tracking sheets, so that students can easily see what courses they have taken and will need to take. This would help increase confidence in students that they are selecting the correct courses for their major or minor. 
                      On a positive note, the “Financials” homepage within the application is well put together. The information boxes on the top banner of the homepage provide important and relevant payment and insurance notifications. The payment dashboard makes it obvious to the student about their outstanding balances and how much they may owe. The make payment and view statement buttons are placed strategically under the balance owed, which makes it easy for the user to take action when they see their owed balance. One critique that could be made is that the outstanding account balance is displayed in three different sections. However, all of these sections have different purposes: one displaying account balance minus aid, one displaying account activity, and one displaying all outstanding charges. It may be beneficial for Workday to combine aspects of all of these sections into one cohesive section to make the dashboard a little less repetitive. Overall, the dashboard provides a clear and detailed view of the student’s financial accounts; users know exactly where to click to pay or view account balances.
                      All things considered, MyWorkday at WPI leaves a lot on the table in terms of possibilities for enhancing the user experience. The site feels like an already developed Workday template that was repurposed to be a WPI scheduling site. There are a lot of unnecessary features that add to the overall complexity of the user experience. Workday should consider taking user feedback to figure out what users actually need. In this manner they will be able to specifically design the site to the students’ needs. With some functional and design adjustments, the application has the potential to provide a seamless and exceptional user experience.

                    <h2 class="text-center"> Art and Design Critique </h2>
                 <p>The workday site could have a better User experience by making it more relatable to the WPI students , for example,  the concept of similarity. Almost all WPI Sites have a standard red and white design whereas Workday has a Blue design. This leads to the user not understanding at the first glance that the Website is related to WPI due to the Similarity not existing.
                  While they have used different sizes, the sizes have not been used in a way that would help users understand the importance of one part over the second part as the sizes have not been standardized. 
                  They have used a standard shape for all the details which would be great for the user to understand what parts are similar. The buttons being in a different shape brings attention to the fact that they are buttons and hence give the users a better experience. 
                  They have the boxes with details separated but the colors are not present to separate the contents of the box from one another. This would lead to an issue for the user to differentiate the contents from one another as there is no color differentiation between them to make it easier. 
                  While the White space is used effectively for the users to better help understand the different sections of the site, the proximity is slightly jarring from the Design perspective as the things in proximity would be better of related to one another to help users reach the section of the site they want to interact with on the site faster and easier</p>
